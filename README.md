# The-Motor-Encoder-Thing

The goal of this project is to get some experience with rotary encoders attached to motors. Tasks:

- [X] Attach a rotary encoder to a motor
- [X] Get the encoder to show ticks on a serial output of an Adafruit Metro Express board
- [ ] Write code to show the rotation speed of the motor in RPM and Hz
- [ ] Use the Metro to generate a PWM signal that can control the motor
- [ ] Get the Metro to send a PWM signal to rotate the motor at a specific RPM value (open loop)
- [ ] Get the Metro to send a PWM signal to dynamically rotate the motor at a specific RPM value (closed loop)
